1) pedestrians don't wait for the field with the smallest static field value to empty if it's taken,
but go to the smallest (or equal because this gives chance to find a smaller one) field instead 
(if it's smaller or equals than the current field). In general, thay try to move all the time except when they would
get further away from exit, which sounds like a real crowd behaviour.

2) implement walls (wasn't specified in lab_5 instruction and it seems that it should have been)

3) add new neighbour type which distinguishes diagonal neighbours from straight ones (as distance to diagonal neighbouring field would be 
greater than to the one that shares the side of the current field) and create static field accordingly

4) element of randomness: for every iteration a person on a field gets theirs "annoyance" counter incremented, and the greater the annoyance,
the more there is a chance that person will move, iven if destination field value is greater than current one

5) walls repulsion: static field value slighly rised close to the walls (the implemementation is very naive and prone to people getting stuck,
so it's turned off by default, can be changed in Board.java, look for // WALL REPULSION)

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT: make pedestrians take longer route, when it is clear that taking shorter route will take more iterations because of high density of crowd
